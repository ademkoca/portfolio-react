# Portfolio website

This is a React version of my portfolio website; the VanillaJS version of this same website can be found [here](https://ademkoca.github.io/portfolio/)

## Tools used

For this project, beside React, I used Bootstrap 5. The content for projects under the "My Work" section is dynamically pulled from JSON file. I used GitHub API to pull information about technologies used and the last commit date, which is displayed in the card footer for each project.

For each project, there is a modal, which is being opened on click, and it shows more information about the project, such as screenshots for all devices sizes.
